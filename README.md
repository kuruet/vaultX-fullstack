# 🚀 SwiftShare – Personal File Sharing Website  

A personal project where I built a **secure, simple, and modern file sharing platform** from scratch.  
This is not just another "upload and download" app – it’s my journey of learning how to design, build, and deploy a complete web application end-to-end.  

---

## ✨ What It Does
- 📤 Upload files easily from your device  
- 🔗 Get a unique shareable link instantly  
- 🔒 Secure handling of files with environment-based configs  
- ⏱️ Fast and lightweight backend for quick transfers  
- 🌐 Live deployed version for anyone to test  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React + TailwindCSS (clean UI, responsive design)  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express  
- **Database/Storage:** MongoDB atlas. Cloudflare R2 S3 
- **Deployment:** Render (for backend) + GitHub for version control  
- **Other Tools:** dotenv for secret management, GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## 📖 My Journey

### 1. 🏁 The Idea
Most people, including me, use platforms like **WhatsApp or Drive** to share files. But:  
- ❌ Using WhatsApp in public raises privacy concerns  
- ⏳ Other platforms waste time with logins and authentication  

I wanted something faster, simpler, and login-free.  
That’s why I built **Dark** — a file-sharing solution with **no login and no auth required**. Just upload → share link → done.  

### 2. 🛠️ Building the Backend
- Designed REST APIs for file upload and retrieval.  
- Added environment variable support (`.env`) to keep things secure.  
- Implemented file storage handling and shareable links.  

### 3. 🎨 Creating the Frontend
- Built project cards to showcase files.  
- Added clean UI with two main buttons: **Live Demo** & **Source Code**.  
- Made navigation simple and recruiter-friendly.  

### 4. 🚀 Deployment
- Pushed project to GitHub (`git push origin main`).  
- Configured `.gitignore` to avoid leaking secrets.  
- Deployed backend on **Render** for public access.  

### 5. 🧪 Testing & Iterating
- Shared files across devices to check speed and security.  
- Fixed edge cases like large file handling.  
- Optimized UI for both desktop and mobile.
